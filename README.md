# Wallet bot

this is a wallet bot.

# Setup:
- Firstly clone this repo where you plan to have the bot hosted as follows:
- Open a terminal where you want the bot files to go, 
and run: `git clone https://github.com/Unknown401/wallet-bot.git`
    *This may prompt you to login since this is a private repo*
afterwards there should be a new folder, navigate to it using `cd wallet-bot` then: 

- Rename `config_example.json` to `config.json` and paste your discord bot token in the token variable.
- Run `npm install` in the console.
- Run the bot with `node index.js` *Or any other runtime you have installed.*

# Requirements:
